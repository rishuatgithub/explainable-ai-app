        If algorithms meet these requirements, they provide a basis for justifying decisions, tracking and thereby verifying them, improving the algorithms, and exploring new facts.

        ** _How a feature effects a prediction?_ **

        Partial Dependence Plots (PDP) show the dependence between the target response and a set of input features of interest, 
        marginalizing over the values of all other input features (the ‘complement’ features). 
        Intuitively, we can interpret the partial dependence as the expected target response as a function of the input features of interest.
        PDP are also used in Google's [What-If Tool](https://pair-code.github.io/what-if-tool/learn/tutorials/walkthrough/).
        The target here is to predict the heart related diseases.

        In PDPs, the y-axis or the feature column predicts the **change in prediction** from what it would be predicted at the baseline or left-most value.

        Let's look into one of the feature: `number_of_major_vessels`. With the increase in the number of vessels, the model thinks 
        the probability of having a heart diseases decreases.

        For feature: `max_heart_rate` the chance of having a heart disease increases with the increase in the heart rate.

        **_How much a prediction was driven by the fact that a person's_ `max_heart_rate` _is greater than 120?_**

        A prediction can be explained by assuming that each feature value of the instance is a “player” in a game where the prediction is the payout. 
        [Shapley values](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/shapley.html) – a method from coalitional game theory – tells us how to fairly distribute the “payout” among the features.
        SHAP values interpret the impact of having a certain value for a given feature in comparison to the prediction we'd make if that feature took some baseline value.

        The SHAP values provide two great advantages:

        - **Global interpretability**: The SHAP values can show how much each predictor contributes, either positively or negatively, to the target variable. 
            This is like the partial dependence plot but it is able to show the positive or negative relationship for each variable with the target.
        - **Local interpretability**: Each observation gets its own set of SHAP values. This greatly increases its transparency. 
                                We can explain why a case receives its prediction and the contributions of the predictors. 
                                Traditional variable importance algorithms only show the results across the entire population but not on each individual case. 
                                The local interpretability enables us to pinpoint and contrast the impacts of the factors.

        The chart on the right hand side shows the indivisual feature contribution towards predicting the model's output.

        If you select a `Person: 1` from the selection box, the model predicted `-2.74`, whereas the base value is `0.50`. 
        Feature values causing increased predictions are in _pink_, and their visual size shows the magnitude of the feature's effect. 
        Feature values decreasing the prediction are in blue. The biggest impact comes from `number_of_major_vessel` being `2`. 
        As we found out in partial dependence plot, having more number of blood vessels in heart decreases the chance of having a heart related diseases.

        However, if you interpret `Person: 2`, the model predicted a shap value of `+1.32` against the base value of `0.50`.
        This person is at a high risk of having a heart disease and most contributing feature increasing the chance of this score are `sex_male` and

        - The Vertical location shows what feature it is depicting
        - Color shows whether that feature was high or low for that row of the dataset
        - Horizontal location shows whether the effect of that value caused a higher or lower prediction.

        In our heart prediction model, `thalassemia_normal` does not quite contribute to the overall model prediction.
        However, features like `age` might contribute to the increase in prediction _(more the age, more is the chances of having disease)_ on specific cases.
        But on a birds-eye view across all the dataset, it doesn't quite play a significant role. 
        The same would go for the `fasting_blood_sugar` and `cholestrol`.
